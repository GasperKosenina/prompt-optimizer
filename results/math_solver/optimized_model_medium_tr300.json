        "question": "The school decided to add 20% to the gym budget. In a normal month, they could buy 15 dodgeballs for $5 each if they spent the entire budget on that. If they only buy softballs instead, which cost $9 each, how many can they buy with the new budget?",
        "reasoning": "To find the new budget after adding 20%, we calculate 120% of the existing budget (100% + 20%). \nIf the school could buy 15 dodgeballs for $5 each, the cost of each dodgeball is $5. \nSo, the cost of buying 15 dodgeballs would be 15 * $5 = $75. \nWith the 20% increase, the new budget would be 120% of $75, which is 1.2 * $75 = $90. \nIf they spend the new budget on softballs at $9 each, they can buy $90 / $9 = 10 softballs.",
        "answer": "They can buy 10 softballs with the new budget."

        "question": "There were 40 kids on Lake Pleasant. A fourth of the kids went tubing, but only half of the tubers went rafting. How many of the kids who joined the rafting excursion were also on the tubing excursion?",
        "reasoning": "Let's first find out how many kids went tubing. Since a fourth of the kids went tubing, we calculate 40 / 4 = 10 kids went tubing.\nThen we find out how many of the tubers went rafting. Since only half of the tubers went rafting, we calculate 10 / 2 = 5 kids went rafting from the tubing group.",

        "question": "Betty picked 16 strawberries. Matthew picked 20 more strawberries than Betty and twice as many as Natalie. They used their strawberries to make jam. One jar of jam used 7 strawberries and they sold each jar at $4. How much money were they able to make from the strawberries they picked?",
        "reasoning": "Let's calculate the total number of strawberries Matthew picked:\nMatthew picked 16 + 20 = 36 strawberries.\nLet's calculate how many strawberries Natalie picked:\nNatalie picked half as many as Matthew, so she picked 36 / 2 = 18 strawberries.\nThe total number of strawberries they picked is 16 + 36 + 18 = 70 strawberries.\nThey can make 70 / 7 = 10 jars of jam.\nIf they sell each jar at $4, they can make 10 * 4 = $40 from the strawberries they picked.",

        "reasoning": "Kendra bought two wooden toys, so the total cost for the toys is 2 * $20 = $40.\nKendra also bought three hats, so the total cost for the hats is 3 * $10 = $30.\nThe total cost for both the toys and hats is $40 + $30 = $70.\nIf Kendra paid with a $100 bill, her change is $100 - $70 = $30.",
