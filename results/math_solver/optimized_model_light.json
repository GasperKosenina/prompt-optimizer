        "question": "Macey saves to buy herself a shirt that costs $3. She was able to save $1.50 already. How many weeks does she need to save for the remaining amount if she saves $0.50 per week?",
        "reasoning": "Macey still needs to save $3 - $1.50 = $1.50.\nWith a weekly saving of $0.50, the number of weeks needed can be calculated by dividing the remaining amount by the weekly saving: $1.50 / $0.50 = 3 weeks.",

        "question": "Barry stands on his head for 10 minutes at a time, but then he must sit for 5 minutes before he can take another turn standing on his head.  How many turns can Barry take standing on his head during a single 2-hour period?",
        "reasoning": "To calculate the number of turns Barry can take standing on his head during a single 2-hour period:\n1. We first determine how many cycles of standing and sitting he can complete in 2 hours.\n2. Each cycle includes 10 minutes of standing and 5 minutes of sitting, which totals to 10 + 5 = 15 minutes.\n3. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, there are 2 hours * 60 minutes = 120 minutes in a 2-hour period.\n4. Thus, Barry can complete 120 minutes / 15 minutes per cycle = 8 cycles in 2 hours.",
        "answer": "Barry can take a total of <<8>>8 turns standing on his head during a single 2-hour period."

        "question": "Giselle had 20 female doves in a birdhouse. After a month, the doves laid 3 eggs each. If 3/4 of the eggs hatched, calculate the total number of doves Giselle has now.",
        "reasoning": "Initially, Giselle had 20 female doves in the birdhouse.\nAfter the doves laid eggs, they will have 20 * 3 = 60 eggs.\nGiven that 3/4 of the eggs hatched, the number of hatched eggs is 60 * 3/4 = 45.\nSince each dove hatches from an egg, the total number of doves Giselle has now is 20 original doves + 45 new doves = 65 doves.",

        "reasoning": "Let's first find out how many kids went tubing. \n1/4 of 40 kids went tubing, so (1/4) * 40 = 40/4 = <<40/4=10>>10 kids went tubing. \nThen, half of the tubers went rafting, so (1/2) * 10 = 10/2 = <<10/2=5>>5 kids who went tubing also went rafting.",
