        "question": "Jack has a stack of books that is 12 inches thick. He knows from experience that 80 pages is one inch thick. If he has 6 books, how many pages is each one on average?",
        "reasoning": "To find the total number of pages in all the books, we first need to find the total thickness of the books in inches. Since 80 pages is 1 inch thick, and Jack's stack of 6 books is 12 inches thick, each book on average is 12 / 6 = 2 inches thick. Given that 80 pages is 1 inch thick, each book on average consists of 2 * 80 = 160 pages.",

        "question": "The school decided to add 20% to the gym budget. In a normal month, they could buy 15 dodgeballs for $5 each if they spent the entire budget on that. If they only buy softballs instead, which cost $9 each, how many can they buy with the new budget?",
        "reasoning": "If the school decided to add 20% to the gym budget, it means they now have 100% + 20% = 120% of the original budget available.\nWith the original budget, they could buy 15 dodgeballs for $5 each, which totals 15 * $5 = $75.\nWith the new budget, they have 120% of the original budget to spend, which is 120/100 * $75 = $90.\nIf softballs cost $9 each, they could buy $90 / $9 = <<90/9=10>>10 softballs with the new budget.",

        "reasoning": "- Each dandelion produces 300 seeds.\n- 1/3rd of the seeds land in water and die, meaning 1/3 * 300 = 300/3 = 100 seeds are lost.\n- 1/6th of the starting number are eaten by insects, so 1/6 * 300 = 300/6 = 50 seeds are eaten.\n- The remaining seeds are (300 - 100 - 50) = 150 seeds.\n- Half of this remainder sprout but are immediately eaten, meaning 150/2 = 75 seeds sprout and are eaten.\n- Only the remaining seeds will survive long enough to flower, which is 150 - 75 = 75 dandelions.",
